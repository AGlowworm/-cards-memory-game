# Card Memory Game

## Project Introduction

- The Card Memory Game is a puzzle game based on the classic memory-matching principle, showcasing modern front-end development best practices through a multi-technology stack implementation. Players are required to flip and match pairs of cards to test and exercise their memory skills.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- The game typically includes multiple cards with identical back designs, while the fronts conceal various patterns, numbers, or images.
- Players can flip two cards each turn.
- Successfully matched pairs remain face-up.
- Unmatched cards are flipped back to their hidden state.

## Technical Implementation
Implemented using:
- JavaScript
- Svelte
- Vue
- React  
- TypeScript

## Project Refactoring
This project will be reconstructed using the following mainstream front-end frameworks/libraries:
- React
- Vue series (Vue.js) 
- Svelte 

## Project Features

### Multi-Technology Stack Implementation
- Developed in both Vanilla JS and modern frameworks (React/Vue/Svelte) for technology comparison
- Enables evaluation of:
  - Development experience
  - Performance characteristics
- Includes TypeScript version demonstrating type-safe coding practices

### Minimalist Design & Efficient Interaction
- Clean, focused interface with essential elements only
- Features:
  - Smooth card animations
  - Optimized state management
  - Highly responsive gameplay

### Modularity & Scalability
- Component-based architecture enables:
  - Feature reuse (timers, scoreboards, etc.)
  - Easy maintenance
- Designed for future expansion:
  - Multiple difficulty levels
  - Theme/skin customization
  - Additional game modes

### Test-Friendly Design
- Includes standardized test data (e.g., number sequence files)
- Supports:
  - Automated testing of matching logic
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Stress testing under heavy load

### Educational & Research Value
- Excellent for comparing frontend technologies:
  - Virtual DOM (React)
  - Reactive programming (Vue)
  - Compiler-based approach (Svelte)
- Demonstrates importance of:
  - Project documentation
  - Code standardization
  - Clear file naming conventions
